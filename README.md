ConceptsDB is a PostgreSQL extension that structures natural language meaning into a queryable geometric representation. This enables developers to write SQL queries that operate on meaning rather than surface syntax or spelling.

The current ambition of ConceptsDB is to model modern English semantics and its vocabulary of approximately 100,000 words.

## Applications

**RAG Pipeline Accuracy** — Solve retrieval intelligence problems: finding precise knowledge, recognizing gaps, handling distributed information across large documents, synthesizing cross-document insights.

**Research Tool** — Built-in explainability and interoperability. "What sources make this answer true?" becomes trivially answerable. Nearby concepts are immediately explorable.

**Codebase Mapping** — Improve AI coding agents by accurately mapping code concepts, enabling better search, understanding, and targeted changes in large codebases.

**News & Policy Mapping** — Track how legislation or court hearings impact your business by mapping conceptual relationships over time.

**Personalized Learning Maps** — Map an individual's conceptual understanding to create personalized learning paths. By visualizing knowledge gaps and connections in a learner's mental model, ConceptsDB enables adaptive education tailored to each person's unique cognitive structure.

**Personalized AI** — Enable AI agents to learn and remember information about you in a queryable way. For example, a web agent booking travel can remember you prefer aisle seats, avoid early morning flights, and always need vegetarian meals—then automatically apply these preferences without asking each time.

**ConceptsDBDB** — Get structured database benefits without the setup cost. ConceptsDB learns conceptual schemas from natural language, so you can query knowledge like a database without spending weeks designing tables and normalizing data. The structure emerges automatically from understanding our natural languages.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why use ConceptsDB instead of a ConceptsDBledge Graph?</summary>

ConceptsDBledge graphs work well for explicit relationships, but have limitations:

**They can't model continuous space** — Everything must be a discrete node. Hard to represent things like color gradients or spatial dimensions.

**Similarity is distance** — Conceptual spaces naturally show "how similar" through geometric proximity. ConceptsDBledge graphs need artificial relationship types instead.

**Concepts combine smoothly** — ConceptsDBledge graphs struggle with "pet fish" - when you combine concepts, the meaning emerges naturally through geometric blending in conceptual spaces.

**Grounded in perception** — Instead of symbols pointing to other symbols, concepts connect to actual perceptual dimensions.

ConceptsDB uses geometric space to mirror how humans actually think about concepts.

<summary>Don't LLMs already do this?</summary>

Neural networks excel at perception and pattern recognition but have limitations:

- **Explainability** — Black box decisions can't be debugged or audited
- **Logic** — Neural nets approximate reasoning but don't guarantee correctness
- **Reliability** — High-stakes domains (law, medicine, finance) require deterministic reasoning
- **Data efficiency** — Rules generalize without massive datasets
- **Truth maintenance** — ConceptsDB avoids hallucinations through validated auditable knowledge

ConceptsDB excels at being citeable, understandable, easily editable.
