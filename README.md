ConceptsLM is the first of its kind conceptual representations language model. By structuring the meaning of natural language as geometric representations ConceptsLM is able to able to generate natural language responses in a fully traceable, debuggable, modifiable, and logical way. This is a drastic evolution from current day langauge models whose internal logic is inscrutable.

The current focus of ConceptsLM is to model the approximately 100,000 words and the semantics of modern day English.

## Applications

**RAG Pipeline Accuracy** — Solve retrieval intelligence problems: finding precise knowledge, recognizing gaps, handling distributed information across large documents, synthesizing cross-document insights.

**Research Tool** — Built-in explainability and interoperability. "What sources make this answer true?" becomes trivially answerable. Nearby concepts are immediately explorable.

**Codebase Mapping** — Improve AI coding agents by accurately mapping code concepts, enabling better search, understanding, and targeted changes in large codebases.

**News & Policy Mapping** — Track how legislation or court hearings impact your business by mapping conceptual relationships over time.

**Personalized Learning Maps** — Map an individual's conceptual understanding to create personalized learning paths. By visualizing knowledge gaps and connections in a learner's mental model, ConceptsLM enables adaptive education tailored to each person's unique cognitive structure.

**Personalized AI** — Enable AI agents to learn and remember information about you in a queryable way. For example, a web agent booking travel can remember you prefer aisle seats, avoid early morning flights, and always need vegetarian meals—then automatically apply these preferences without asking each time.

**Big Data Searching** — Get structured database benefits without the setup cost. ConceptsLM learns conceptual schemas from natural language, so you can query knowledge like a database without spending weeks designing tables and normalizing data. The structure emerges automatically from understanding our natural languages.
