Know is a new approach to storing and searching all human knowledge in a way that is both computer searchable and human readable.

## Approach

Build a conceptual map in digital geometric space that humans and AI share. When humans can inspect the conceptual structure, AI results become debuggable, citable, and trustworthy.

## Applications

**RAG Pipeline Accuracy** — Solve retrieval intelligence problems: finding precise knowledge, recognizing gaps, handling distributed information across large documents, synthesizing cross-document insights.

**Research Tool** — Built-in explainability and interoperability. "What sources make this answer true?" becomes trivially answerable. Nearby concepts are immediately explorable.

**Codebase Mapping** — Improve AI coding agents by accurately mapping code concepts, enabling better search, understanding, and targeted changes in large codebases.

**News & Policy Mapping** — Track how legislation or court hearings impact your business by mapping conceptual relationships over time.

**Personalized Learning Maps** — Map an individual's conceptual understanding to create personalized learning paths. By visualizing knowledge gaps and connections in a learner's mental model, Know enables adaptive education tailored to each person's unique cognitive structure.

**Personalized AI** — Enable AI agents to learn and remember information about you in a queryable way. For example, a web agent booking travel can remember you prefer aisle seats, avoid early morning flights, and always need vegetarian meals—then automatically apply these preferences without asking each time.

**KnowDB** — Get structured database benefits without the setup cost. Know learns conceptual schemas from natural language, so you can query knowledge like a database without spending weeks designing tables and normalizing data. The structure emerges automatically from understanding our natural languages.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why use Know instead of a Knowledge Graph?</summary>

Knowledge graphs work well for explicit relationships, but have limitations:

**They can't model continuous space** — Everything must be a discrete node. Hard to represent things like color gradients or spatial dimensions.

**Similarity is distance** — Conceptual spaces naturally show "how similar" through geometric proximity. Knowledge graphs need artificial relationship types instead.

**Concepts combine smoothly** — Knowledge graphs struggle with "pet fish" - when you combine concepts, the meaning emerges naturally through geometric blending in conceptual spaces.

**Grounded in perception** — Instead of symbols pointing to other symbols, concepts connect to actual perceptual dimensions.

Know uses geometric space to mirror how humans actually think about concepts.

<summary>Don't LLMs already do this?</summary>

Neural networks excel at perception and pattern recognition but have limitations:

- **Explainability** — Black box decisions can't be debugged or audited
- **Logic** — Neural nets approximate reasoning but don't guarantee correctness
- **Reliability** — High-stakes domains (law, medicine, finance) require deterministic reasoning
- **Data efficiency** — Rules generalize without massive datasets
- **Truth maintenance** — Symbolic systems avoid hallucinations through validated knowledge

Know excels at being citeable, understandable, easily editable.
