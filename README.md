Large language models are powerful but opaque, expensive, and difficult to control. ConceptsLM is building the first conceptual representations language model (CRLM), replacing statistical patterns with geometric concept representations. By structuring the semantic meaning of natural language geometrically, ConceptsLM will achieve intelligent language generation with full transparency and near-zero inference computational cost.

1. ConceptsLM will be composed of only human-readable code and will be fully CPU executable, traceable, debuggable, modifiable, versionable, and portable to any runtime or device.
2. The speed of inference will be near instantaneous.
3. The cost of inference will be near zero.
4. There will be no context limit.
5. ConceptsLM will support memory and recall
6. ConceptsLM will be queryable like a relational database.
7. Deductive and inductive reasoning are possible based on the structure of the representation.

The heart of ConceptsLM is the quality of its representational model. The current focus of this project is to model the approximately 100,000 words and the semantics of modern day English. This work is ongoing. 

## Applications

**RAG Pipeline Accuracy** — Solve retrieval intelligence problems: finding precise knowledge, recognizing gaps, handling distributed information across large documents, synthesizing cross-document insights.

**Research Tool** — Built-in explainability and interoperability. "What sources make this answer true?" becomes trivially answerable. Nearby concepts are immediately explorable.

**Codebase Mapping** — Improve AI coding agents by accurately mapping code concepts, enabling better search, understanding, and targeted changes in large codebases.

**News & Policy Mapping** — Track how legislation or court hearings impact your business by mapping conceptual relationships over time.

**Personalized Learning Maps** — Map an individual's conceptual understanding to create personalized learning paths. By visualizing knowledge gaps and connections in a learner's mental model, ConceptsLM enables adaptive education tailored to each person's unique cognitive structure.

**Personalized AI** — Enable AI agents to learn and remember information about you in a queryable way. For example, a web agent booking travel can remember you prefer aisle seats, avoid early morning flights, and always need vegetarian meals—then automatically apply these preferences without asking each time.

**Big Data Searching** — Get structured database benefits without the setup cost. ConceptsLM learns conceptual schemas from natural language, so you can query knowledge like a database without spending weeks designing tables and normalizing data. The structure emerges automatically from understanding our natural languages.
