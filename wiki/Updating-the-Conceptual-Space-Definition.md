## What We Store: Theories, Not Data Points

The data stored in conceptual spaces represents **high-level conceptual theories** rather than raw sub-conceptual data. Peter Gärdenfors illustrates this with the jungle analogy: when we think about a jungle, we don't store every individual tree, leaf, and vine we encountered. Instead, we form a high-level theory of "jungle-ness" that captures the essential patterns and qualities. Similarly, ConceptsDB stores theories like "the theory of the color of apples" (the typical color regions apples occupy) and "the theory of the shape of apples" (their characteristic roundness and size) rather than coordinates for thousands of individual apple instances. This approach operates at the conceptual and symbolic levels of representation, abstracting away from sub-conceptual sensory data to capture generalizable patterns and high-level structures that define our understanding.
