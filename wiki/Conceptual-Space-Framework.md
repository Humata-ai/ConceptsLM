# Conceptual Space Framework
The framework we are applying to model concepts as geometry is built upon the work Peter Gardenfors has done in his two books Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought and the Geometry of Meaning: Semantics Based on Conceptual Spaces. 

That being said, this document details how the process unfolds.

## Overview

The conceptual space framework provides a geometric representation of concepts, allowing us to model semantic relationships spatially.
