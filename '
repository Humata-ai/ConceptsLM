# Visaulize apple in know visualizer

~/Dropbox/github/Humata-ai/know/visualizer/app/page.tsx

At some point I want to add a component library. Its great to get a basic visualization up and out.

So I want to have the text section on the left side. It will be an texta area where we will be able to enter text. The component will output an onChange property that will fire onKeyUp. 

On the right side we will have the visualizer. Right now the visualizer will only work for the word "apple". For any other word, other then apple, the visualizer will say -- Unknown concept: "whatever is written in the textarea that is not apple" (Currently `apple` is the only visualized concept)

Next inside the visualizer if "apple" is present (and only "apple") then we want to show a rendering tth

  Here we want it todo like all sorts of schema visualization but also lots of cool zooming and all sorts of stuff

So three.js does seem like the way to go

So here is the deal...

I know that I'll have to create like at least 4 or 5 conceptual spaces for "apple". I know color will need to be one of them. It makes a lot of sense to start with color as the first space to model in conceptual space.
- Also I can work on the API and underlying language of conceptual spaces representation that I need to visualize anything. In short, I want the way I build this first conceptual space to be generic and reusable to the other representations that need to build.
- One great advantage is that not everything needs to be spot on. Once we start listing "truths" those "truths" will help correct and label the conceptual space.

Here are the spaces we need...

```nu
"according to the book 'conceptual spaces' what are the spaces needed to represent apple?" | claude -p | save -a '~/Dropbox/notes/GTD/projects/active_projects/know/create_conceptual_space_visualizer/Visaulize apple in know visualizer.md'
```

Create spaces for these...
- [x] **Color space** - representing the color dimensions (hue, saturation, brightness)
  - ~/Dropbox/github/Humata-ai/know/visualizer/app/components/RGBColorCube.tsx
- [x] **Taste space** - representing taste qualities (sweetness, sourness, bitterness)
  - [x] [[visualize_a_conceptual_space_for_taste.md]]
- [x] **Shape space** - representing geometric properties
  - [x] [[visualize_a_conceptual_space_for_the_shape_of_an_apple.md]] ^next-action
- I can go on to add other spaces too...
  - **Texture space** - representing tactile properties (hardness, smoothness)
  - Genealogy of Fruits
  - And other additional information...


- [x] Run this prompt through claude code
```nu
cd ~/Dropbox/github/Humata-ai/know
"Okay the next step here is that we want all the three graphs to be visible at the same time" | claude --resume bab354a5-3887-4de0-ac76-bb8f33435355
```

Okay this is good.

Now what I aim todo is get the animation for the "hover" of apple

Basically what is going to happen is that there will be a section

In this section we will input information

So I think I want todo a refactor of this guy
